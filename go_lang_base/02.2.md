# IDE
关于IDE每个人的喜好都不同，你可以使用较为独立的开发环境LiteIDE，也可以是VS或者Eclipse，甚至是notepad++，当然更不用说vim和emacs了。在这里，一种我比较喜欢的IDE：LiteIDE。


## LiteIDE

[LiteIDE](https://github.com/visualfc/liteide)算是集成的非常好Go IDE了，编译，调试，代码补全，功能可谓应有尽有。而且免费，开源，基于QT所以还跨平台。其安装异常简单，从[官网](https://code.google.com/p/liteide/)上下载对应平台的安装包，然后解压到指定目录即可。如果无法访问，可以去[镜像](http://www.golangtc.com/download/liteide)下载。

## Gogland
Software development company JetBrains released another reliable IDE, but this time, for Golang. [Gogland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) is a commercial IDE that provides a robust ergonomic environment for Go developers. It also features coding assistance, a debugger, and an integrated terminal.

Because an established company created Gogland, it has an extensive IntelliJ plugin ecosystem where you can get additional tools, should you need more.

## Visual Studio Code
Created by Microsoft, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a full-featured, open-source IDE and code editor that supports a wide variety of programming languages. It features smart completion with IntelliSense; debugging using breakpoints, call stacks, and an interactive console; built-in Git integration; and a hierarchical folder and file explorer.

As another popular IDE, Visual Studio Code has a supportive community of Go developers that regularly contribute. With Visual Studio Code, you can extend functionalities with the array of available plugins.

## Wide
[Wide](https://github.com/b3log/wide) is a web-based IDE for Golang programmers. It’s designed for collaborative development and works best for teams and web development agencies. Wide features include code highlight, debugging, Git integration, and more.

Because Wide is created and maintained by a Chinese developer, most of its documentation and support are in Chinese.

## Atom With Go-Plus Plugin
If you’re already using Atom, your code editing experience in Golang can be improved with an open-source package called [go-plus](https://atom.io/packages/go-plus). With go-plus, you get instant, real-time feedback on your syntax and build errors.

The go-plus package offers almost all Golang support in Atom. It can also be used for tools, build flows, linters, vet, and coverage tools.

Go-plus also includes various code snippets and features such as autocomplete with gocode, code formatting with gofmt, goreturns, or goimports, and more.

## Eclipse With GoClipse
Because Eclipse is a widely popular IDE, numerous plugins have been created for it. GoClipse is an Eclipse plugin for Golang that offers Go source code editing with configurable syntax highlighting and automatic indentation and brace completion.

[GoClipse](https://github.com/GoClipse/goclipse) also serves as a project wizard and builder that reports syntax and build errors instantly. Additional features of GoClipse include debugging functionality and code assist.
